INITIAL SEGMENT
---------------
This part should be emblematic of the rest of the game.
Teach players what to expect. Don't teach anything that will become irrelevant or contradicted.
Find ways to keep it interesting between runs

living at home

get told by parents to go with little brother down to the creek

go outside with brother
	talks about 
		wanting to catch eels
		seeing how far down the river you can get this time
		throwing big rocks into the water - he'll try not to splash you
		can we go to the big deep pool
		
platforming through the yard, down the steps to the creek

he runs ahead, faster than you can go - find him being threatened by a [random forest critter]

fight it off, he says not to hurt it
		can kill it with some foreshadowed environemental hazard? eg rocks fall
	if not fought off soon enough, kills brother.
	if spared, limps away and returns later
	if killed, get its ATP
